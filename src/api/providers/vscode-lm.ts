/**
 * Recovery for leaked tool calls
 * ------------------------------
 * Some VS Code LM backends — notably GitHub Copilot serving Anthropic Claude models —
 * intermittently stream a tool call as PLAIN TEXT using Anthropic's internal function-call
 * XML instead of emitting a structured `LanguageModelToolCallPart`. When this happens the
 * assistant turn contains no tool_use block, so Zoo reports "no tools used" and the task stalls
 * in a retry loop. The helpers below detect the leaked markup mid-stream and replay it as a real
 * tool call. Recovery is deliberately conservative: only `<invoke>` blocks whose name matches a
 * tool we actually offered this turn are treated as calls; everything else is passed through
 * unchanged as text.
 *
 * SCOPE: only the WRAPPED variant — an `<invoke>` inside an open `<function_calls>` wrapper — is
 * recovered. A bare, unwrapped `<invoke>` is deliberately left as text: we have no observation of
 * this backend emitting one, while quoted examples and prompt-injected file content routinely
 * contain bare markup, so passing it through is the safer default rather than a security boundary.
 * Widening to the bare case needs a reproduction first.
