 * boundary, closes the hole where a request like `%2e%2e/%2e%2e/.env` passes
 * containment as a literal and escapes only after the later decode. Decoding
 * repeats until the value is stable so double-encoded payloads
 * (`%252e%252e`) are caught as well.
 *
 * Values containing a bare `%` that is not a valid escape (e.g.
 * `report 50%.md`) are returned unchanged — the same lenient semantics
 * openFile already applies. A value that does not stabilize within
 * `maxIterations` is a hostile encoding and rejected with `null`.
